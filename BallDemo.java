         * to be accessed via different methods (keys) and but can be
         * accessed without order. While we don't care which ball bounces
         * when, and we need to move them all. HashMap might overcomplicate
         * the iteration, as we need to keep track of each balls access
         * key individually.
         * 
         * HashSet: A Set automatically prevents duplicate objects and
         * stores only individual ones. Since the balls can be similar
         * objects, deleting (or even risking it) would be bad. Best
